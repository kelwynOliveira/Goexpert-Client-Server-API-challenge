# Client server API challenge

Hi dev, what's up?
 
In this challenge we're going to apply what we've learnt about http webserver, contexts,
database and file manipulation with Go.
 
You'll need to deliver two Go systems:
- client.go
- server.go
 
The requirements to fulfil this challenge are:
 
The client.go should make an HTTP request to server.go asking for the dollar exchange rate.
 
server.go must consume the API containing the Dollar/Real exchange rate at the address: https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/last/USD-BRL and then return the result to the client in JSON format.
 
Using the "context" package, server.go should record each quotation received in the SQLite database, with the maximum timeout for calling the dollar quote API being 200ms and the maximum timeout for persisting the data in the database being 10ms.
 
The client.go will only need to receive the current exchange rate from the server.go (JSON "bid" field). Using the "context" package, client.go will have a maximum timeout of 300ms to receive the result from server.go.
 
The 3 contexts should return an error in the logs if the execution time is insufficient.
 
The client.go will have to save the current exchange rate in a "cotacao.txt" file in the following format: Dollar: {value}
 
The necessary endpoint generated by server.go for this challenge will be: /cotacao and the port to be used by the HTTP server will be 8080.
 
When finalised, send the link to the repository for correction.
