# What is the GO language

Why create a new language when there is a lot of good options like, Java, C#, Python...?

> Also called Golang, but its name is Go. So we say that we know how to program in Go. The issue here is that Go is a generic word, which is troublesome when we search for it on Google. To make it easier to search for it we also call Go as Golang.

## Go Features

1. It is an open source language with the aim of making programmers more productive.
1. It is an expressive language, concise, clean and efficient. Compared to other languages which have a lot of ways to do a program that obtains the same result, Go programs go on the other way, it tries to be simpler.
1. It is a modern language, created to make the usage of multicore resources and network. While when the other languages where created there where not so many core resources (normally only one CPU) and the network usage was not compared to what we have today. Maybe those languages have some adaptation to make use of these resources, but Go was created with this in mind.
1. It is a compiled language. Despite being a compiled language this compilation is really fast, at the same time it works with garbage collection. It means we do not have to be worried about memory usage.
1. It is fast, statically typed and compiled. But at the same time Go seams to be dynamically typed because it can infer types, and seams to be interpreted because its compilation is fast.
1. Go is compiled in a binary file.
