# Motives

1. Go was created due the fact of others languages that where being used at Google having some limitations (Python, Java and C++)
1. Python had problems with slowness.
1. C/C++: there where a lot of complexity and delay in compiling.
1. Java is largely used on Google, but over time it generates complexity to the code. Java is also a verbosity language.
1. The other languages did not born thinking about multithread and concurrence.
1. They wanted a simply language.
1. Unlike other languages where there is a Framework for each thing having to download a lot of things, Go tries to have natively his own test Framework and profiling.
1. Go can detect Race Conditions.
1. Simplicity on deployment. There is only one binary file.
1. Low learning curve.
