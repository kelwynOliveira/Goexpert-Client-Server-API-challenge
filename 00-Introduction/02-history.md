# GO History

Go was born at Google and created by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson (both have participated on the Unix and UTF-8 creation) and Robert Griesemar (Creator of the V8 engine).

The language Go project started on September 2007, its first version (v1.0) was launched to the public on 2012. On v1.5 its compiler was totally programmed in Go.

Since its launch the Go lang is backward compatible for all version 1, it means that even if there is an update and your code was created on a posterior version it will still work on any previous or future versions.
